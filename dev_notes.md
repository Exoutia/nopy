# Nopy
This is nopy and simple note taking app made using python. 
I have always been interested in making software that can be used to take notes in python. 

## Features 
- [ ] Able to write notes and able to store it into local storage.
- [ ] Able to search notes.
- [ ] Able to connect notes just like we can do in obsidian.

> For now these are all the features that I want to copy in noty.
